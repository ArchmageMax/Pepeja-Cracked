The extremely scuffed 2d unity game of JC and Max [SAMPLE TEXT]

We want to create a quick and fun game to play, and relieve stress during breaks from studying. We want our entertaining game to be centred around flying about freely in aeroplanes or other flying objects (in 2D).

Quick load times on most hardware will promote gaming among friends and family to relieve stress during long periods of social isolation.

We aim to create a simple, mobile, fun multiplayer plane combat simulator prioritising accessibility through software optimisation, without the need for high end mobile gaming devices (Nintendo Switch, Current generation Flagship mobile phones).
